BitchX 1.2 README
=================

/NAMES and /SCAN
----------------

The formatting of /NAMES and /SCAN output has been substantially reworked.
The old /FSETs NAMES_BOTCOLOR, NAMES_FRIENDCOLOR, NAMES_NICKCOLOR,
NAMES_OPCOLOR, NAMES_SHITCOLOR and NAMES_VOICECOLOR have been replaced
with these new /FSETs:

....................NAMES_NICK %B$[10]0
................NAMES_NICK_BOT %G$[10]0
.............NAMES_NICK_FRIEND %Y$[10]0
.................NAMES_NICK_ME %W$[10]0
...............NAMES_NICK_SHIT %R$[10]0
....................NAMES_USER %K[ %n$1-%K]
.............NAMES_USER_CHANOP %K[%C$0%n$1-%K]
..............NAMES_USER_IRCOP %K[%R$0%n$1-%K]
..............NAMES_USER_VOICE %K[%M$0%n$1-%K]

The NAMES_NICK formats control how the nick itself is displayed, depending
on the status of the nick as recognised by BitchX (the priority order is
NAMES_NICK_ME > NAMES_NICK_BOT > NAMES_NICK_FRIEND > NAMES_NICK_SHIT >
NAMES_NICK).  The NAMES_USER formats control how the overall entry appears in
the /NAMES or /SCAN line, depending on the channel status of the nick (the
priority order is NAMES_USER_CHANOP > NAMES_USER_VOICE > NAMES_USER_IRCOP >
NAMES_USER).

You'll need to update any scripts or custom formats that altered the old
formats.  If you just use the defaults, the main difference you'll see is
that your own nick is now shown in white, and voiced users are shown with
the '+' sent by the server instead of the 'v'.  You can go back to the old
look by setting these formats:

/FSET NAMES_NICK_ME %B$[10]0
/FSET NAMES_USER_VOICE %K[%Mv%n$1-%K]

Also, the NAMES header and NAMES_FOOTER formats are now called with $3 set
to the total number of nicks in the channel, and $4 to the mask given to
/SCAN (if any).

/SCAN now supports a new sort flag "-stat", which sorts the output by
channel status (chanops, then halfops, then voices, then the riff-raff).

/HOP and /DEHOP
---------------

New commands /HOP and /DEHOP have been added, to give and remove halfop
status (on servers that support it).

PLUGINS
-------

The "scan" plugin has been removed - its functionality is now built-in,
accessed by /scan -stat (see above). If you want this to be the default, 
just set this alias (the double-slash is REQUIRED):

/ALIAS SCAN { //SCAN -STAT }
