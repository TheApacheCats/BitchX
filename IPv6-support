  ./configure --enable-ipv6

virtual hosts
  from now on you can use `-norev' parameter with `/irchost' to turn off
  name resolving, because it sometimes is veeery looong :)

command line and `/server'
  their parameters are delimited with a colon, just like 16-bit words in
  IPv6 addrs. so now you can also use a comma instead of `:'. for example,
  both `/server dead::beef' and `/server dead::beef:6667' won't do, because
  BitchX will try to connect to server `dead' with password `beef'. instead
  use `/server dead::beef,' (note the comma) and `/server dead::beef,6667'.
  the same rule applies to command line parameters.

dcc stuff
  only v4 dcc is supported. ctcp/2 is much too complicated for me :) if you
  want to use IPv6 virtual hosts and still be able to initiate dcc, you need
  to set NAT_ADDRESS to any of your IPv4 addrs.
